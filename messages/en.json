Rooms in a fantastically revitalized farm building with a huge lounge for shared meals or meetings. By the way, it has been a long time since I had such a wonderful homemade breakfast. Dziewanna can host both peace-seeking loners and large groups. Overall, you don't get the 'hotel impression' but rather a homey atmosphere, for example through the arrangement of the apartments. No matter what you write, the most important thing is the sensational hosts: kind, very friendly, always at your disposal, simply normal. Highly recommended.",
